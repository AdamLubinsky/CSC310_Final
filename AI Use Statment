# AI Use Statement

**Summary**
Generative AI helped craft the `Lubinsky_Final.ipynb` notebook, streamline documentation, and speed up maintenance tasks. All machine suggestions were reviewed, tested and edited by a contributor before committing.

**Detailed explanation**
ChatGPT and Gemini were consulted to propose feature engineering steps, fairness checks and user interface elements for the notebook. Generated code was executed and manually revised to ensure accuracy and compliance with project guidelines.

These same tools refined README language and answered questions about library behavior. GitHub Copilot (Codex) drafted commit messages and CI configurations. Every change passed human review and testing prior to merge.

No AI output was accepted without oversight. Prompts contained no sensitive data, and all resulting content is released under the repository’s license in line with each model provider’s terms.
